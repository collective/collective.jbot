More important
--------------

* integrate with Diazo theming panel, and still keep separate jbot configlet
* Swap customization precedence so that jbot configlet customizations override customizations in the theme
* clean up UI, make sure button text make sense, style with bootstrap (for Plone 5)
* make plone.resourceeditor look prettier
* When you click the customize button, the template should automatically open in the editor
* add function to search within templates, with warning that it may be slow

Less urgent
-----------

* display HTML/TAL errors in the template. Display as a warning before saving with buttons: “Go back to editing” and “Save anyway”
* have ability to add new views (not overrides) that could then be used in Diazo
